Hello, and welcome to cm, the Concise Markup compiler.

It's not finished yet. Not even close to alpha. It doesn't even sort of work.
I wouldn't suggest trying to use it.

In fact, it's sort of dead. I eventually switched over to a lisp-like syntax.
You can find CM's descendant, hisp, elswere on my github.
