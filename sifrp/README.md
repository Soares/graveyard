This is a dice roller & character sheet system for the Song of Ice and
Fire RPG. I built it and used it during the extent of the game.

The game has now concluded (or has it!?) and I moved to Seattle, so this
won't be seeing much love, unless Andrew Daniel Fiske McFarlin gets off
his ass and runs some more games. (And I move back to VT, that's
probably important too.)
