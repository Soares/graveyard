Get better auto completion (from tags & language)

# Runtime files that need to be overridden
Vim: allow \\}) to be valid syntax
Java: chokes when ') {' is on different line of function def.

# Forks that need to be made
Syntastic: needs to be re-entrable.
Surround: cs{[ adds spaces {directory}â†’[ directory ]
CtrlP:
	stop jumping me to the window where it's open.
	ignore doc/tags
