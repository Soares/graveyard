This is where good code goes to die.

Code is never completed, only abandoned. But when it's abandoned before
it works, it goes to the graveyard.

Tread with caution ye who enter here.

Sometimes projects get abandoned due to lack of time, change in plans,or
better ideas.

I'm not going to throw away all the old code, because people might be
able to learn a thing or two from it. And because it might be hilarious
for me to come back and poke around later.

But be warned: beyond this point lie ghosts of the past, half-alive all
dead, abandoned for want of maintenance. They were all alive once, but now
their guts hang out all over the place.

(i.e. ".git" has been moved to "git")
